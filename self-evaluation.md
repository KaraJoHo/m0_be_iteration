# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I am getting the hang of it.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

Yes and yes. I think I am learning that google is my friend. My productive struggle is when I am unable to figure something out with what i have already learned. So I'll take the time to google a solution and experiment with different ideas. The unproductive struggle hits when I can't find a solution and I just need to step away.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I am enjoying experimenting through a practice file or IDE just to test out different methods and such. also finding practice problems online to play with and see if I can solve them. I usually spend an hour in the evening doing this after completing any other work.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Right now I am doing okay with searching for my questions online. I think I am starting to run into some difficulty figuring out syntax errors.
